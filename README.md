# Authentication - GraphQL

The Authentication is a web application which allows you to Sign Up and Sign In using React and GraphQL for queries. Also, the application uses MongoDB to store user data and PassportJS to handle the authentication, login and sign up users. So the app saves users cookies so that we can know them at the login page and to sign up a new user.
